This is a Personal Learning Project where I am trying to learn new technologies I am interested in, such as the following: docker, basic backend development, python, flask, rust, compose, react-native, etc.

The repository will consist of multiple implementations of the same server and client with different variations and technologies.

> As this is a learning project, nothing you see here should be considered production ready or pattern.
> I am playing with different, unkown to me, technologies and learn from them. I am not too concerned about security and I implement things on my own for which in production battle tested libraries should be used instead (such as authentication, password storage etc.)
